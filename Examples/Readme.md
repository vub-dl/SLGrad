# Examples

This folder contains example parameter configurations for running experiments on the following datasets:

- Toy Regression dataset with and without noise: two task regression dataset as described in our paper. 

- NYUv2 [[1]](#1): multi-task setup (3 tasks) as discussed in [[2]](#2)

- CIFAR10 [[3]](#3): multi-task setup (10 binary tasks) with and without 60 percent of uniformly flipped labels for the main task, as described in our paper. 

- Multi-MNIST [[4]](#4): two-task setup up consisting of the recognition of the left and right digit, as described in our paper
