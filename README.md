## Setup

Before running experiments, make sure the required dependencies are installed:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

To run the experiments on your own device, make sure to unpack all files (folders as well). 

The results of the experiments will be automatically logged to Weights and Biases https://wandb.ai/site. Make sure to create an account before starting the experiments.   
## Usage

To run benchmark experiments with different dynamic weighting algorithms on different (semi) synthetic and real-world datasets, run the **run_experiments.py** file. 

Before running the code, specify the configuration in the dictionary provided in the  **run_experiments.py**
Explain the dictionary of run_experiments.py
